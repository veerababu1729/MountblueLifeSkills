# Tiny Habits

## Question 1
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**  
BJ Fogg says start with tiny things like floss one tooth or do one push-up after toilet. Small steps grow big habits that stay. I like this most.

## Question 2
**How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A and P?**  
B = MAP means Behavior happens with Motivation, Ability and Prompt. M is want to do it. A is make it easy. P is reminder to do it. Use it by making habit super small so even low want works.

## Question 3
**Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful habit?**  
Shine means feel happy inside right after you do it, like a dog wags tail for treat. This wires your brain to love the habit and repeat fast. What you celebrate turns into habit.

## Question 4
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**  
Bike team got 1% better in sleep, food, wash hands and bike parts. They won big races after years. Tiny daily wins add up huge.

## Question 5
**What is the book's perspective about Identity?**  
Change who you are, not just what you do. Each habit votes for your identity like "I am a coder" when you code. Many votes make it real.

## Question 6
**Book's view on how to make a habit easier to do?**  
Make reminder very clear in sight. Pair with something fun. Start in under 2 minutes. Prep tools ready. Cut steps to few.

## Question 7
**Book's view on how to make a habit harder to do?**  
Hide the reminder. Link to bad feelings. Add extra hard steps. Make end feel no good.

## Question 8
**Pick one habit to do more. Steps to make cue obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying?**  
Habit: Code Python every day.  
- Cue: Put notebook with "Code Now" by my tea cup.  
- Attractive: Play favorite song before start.  
- Easy: Just open laptop and write 1 line.  
- Satisfying: Say "Yes I did it!" and fist pump.

## Question 9
**Pick one habit to do less. Steps to make cue invisible, unattractive, hard, unsatisfying?**  
Habit: Scroll phone too much.  
- Invisible: Put phone in drawer after work.  
- Unattractive: I tell myself "This wastes my code time."  
- Hard: Delete apps.
- Unsatisfying: Time wasted and feel bad about it.
