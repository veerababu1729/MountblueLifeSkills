# Listening and Active Communication

## Question 1 – Steps for Active Listening

1. Put your phone away and focus on the speaker.
2. Don't interrupt — let them finish first.
3. Maintain eye contact to show you're listening.
4. Don't assume what they'll say — hear them out fully.
5. Ask questions if something is unclear.
6. Repeat back what you heard to confirm you understood correctly.

## Question 2 – Fisher's Model of Reflective Listening

- Listen without judging the other person.
- Understand their feelings, not just their words.
- Repeat back what you heard and check if you got it right.
- Match your body language — nod, make eye contact, stay open.
- Make the person feel safe enough to talk freely.

## Question 3 – Obstacles in My Listening

- My phone distracts me easily.
- I start thinking of my reply before the person finishes.
- My mind wanders when the topic is long or boring.
- I react emotionally when I hear something I disagree with.

## Question 4 – How I Can Improve My Listening

- Keep my phone away during conversations.
- Wait for the person to finish before I respond.
- Take notes in meetings and technical discussions.
- Summarize what I heard at the end to confirm understanding.

## Question 5 – When I Go Passive

- When I disagree with a professor or senior but don't want conflict.
- In group projects when my idea is rejected — I just go along with it.
- When I'm tired and say "okay fine" just to end the conversation.

## Question 6 – When I Go Aggressive

- When someone repeatedly ignores my points, I get loud and blunt.
- Under deadline stress, if someone makes a mistake I react sharply.
- When I feel disrespected, I respond defensively without thinking.

---

## Question 7 – When I Go Passive Aggressive

- I give short replies or silent treatment when I'm annoyed.
- I use sarcasm like "oh great, another last-minute change" instead of saying I'm frustrated.
- I delay replying to messages when I'm upset with someone.

---

## Question 8 – How to Be More Assertive

- Say "I feel..." instead of blaming — example: "I feel ignored when interrupted."
- Be direct — if I disagree, just say so with a reason.
- Say no when I'm overloaded instead of silently resenting it.
- Stay calm — control my tone even when I'm frustrated.
- Pause before reacting in heated moments so I don't get aggressive.
